                    <h2 class="text-decoration-underline float-start">Kobe 4 Protro sneakers</h2>
                    <p class="float-start"><img class="float-end" src="Images/blue.kobe.jpg" alt="blue.kobe">Supplied by a premier sneaker marketplace dealing with unworn, already sold out, in demand rarities. Each product is rigorously inspected by experienced experts guaranteeing authenticity. The Undefeated x Nike Kobe 4 Protro PE “DeMar DeRozan” is an exclusive colorway made for San Antonio Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan. The former USC basketball star is one of four Team Kobe members to receive a makeover specific to his team’s uniform colors in conjunction with Undefeated’s collaboration with Nike Basketball on the Kobe 4. 
                        Using retro Spurs colors as the inspiration behind the design, the base features a teal Flywire mid-panel base with a mango outlined black Swoosh on top. A teal patent leather covers the toe, ankle collar, and heel. Bright mango accents are found on the sock-liner, as well as on the dual-branded tongues featuring both Undefeated and Kobe logos. The numbers “8” and “24” that Bryant wore during his time as a Laker, appear in orange on the heel. Completing the low-top silhouette is a semi-translucent orange and white outsole.
                        The Undefeated x Nike Kobe 4 Protro PE “DeMar DeRozan” was released on August 24th, 2019.
